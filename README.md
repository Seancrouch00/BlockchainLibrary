# BlockchainLibrary

**BlockchainLibrary** is a modular and extensible blockchain framework for building decentralized applications (dApps), creating custom blockchain solutions, and exploring cryptographic protocols. This library provides essential components such as block and transaction management, consensus mechanisms (like DPoS and PoS), privacy enhancements, and support for scalable solutions such as sharding.

## Installation

You can install **BlockchainLibrary** by downloading or cloning this repository and adding the `BlockchainLibrary.dll` to your project.

### Prerequisites

- **.NET Framework** 4.7.2 or higher / .NET Core
- Basic knowledge of C# and blockchain concepts

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seancrouch00/BlockchainLibrary.git
```

2. Build the project using **Visual Studio** or **.NET CLI**.

3. Add the `BlockchainLibrary.dll` reference to your project.

4. In your code, reference the library:

```csharp
using BlockchainLibrary;
```

## Getting Started

Below is a quick start guide for using **BlockchainLibrary** in your project:

### Initializing the Blockchain

```csharp
// Initialize a new blockchain with 2 shards (optional)
Blockchain blockchain = new Blockchain(2);
```

### Adding Transactions

```csharp
// Create a new transaction from 'address1' to 'address2' with an amount of 100
Transaction tx = new Transaction("address1", "address2", 100.0M);
blockchain.AddTransaction(tx);
```

### Mining a Block

```csharp
// Process and mine the pending transactions into a new block
blockchain.ProcessTransactions("ValidatorAddress");
```

### Viewing the Blockchain

```csharp
// Loop through blocks and display the transactions
foreach (var block in blockchain.Chain)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Block {block.Index} - Hash: {block.Hash}");
    foreach (var tx in block.Transactions)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  {tx.FromAddress} -> {tx.ToAddress}: {tx.Amount}");
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Blocks and Transactions

Each block contains multiple transactions, and every transaction has a sender (`FromAddress`), a recipient (`ToAddress`), and an `Amount`. The blockchain ensures the integrity of each block by linking them through cryptographic hashes.

### Consensus Mechanisms

#### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

- In DPoS, stakeholders vote for delegates who are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the chain.
- The more tokens a stakeholder holds, the more voting power they have.

#### Proof of Stake (PoS)

- In PoS, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of stake they hold in the network.
- Validators are rewarded for their participation, and malicious behavior is discouraged through slashing.

### Sharding

Sharding splits the blockchain into multiple parallel **shard chains**, each responsible for processing a portion of the transactions. The **Beacon Chain** manages all shards and ensures cross-shard transactions are processed smoothly.

### Privacy

To enhance transaction privacy, **BlockchainLibrary** includes:
- **Stealth Addresses**: Generates one-time addresses for each transaction, making it harder to link transactions to specific users.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Verifies the validity of a transaction without revealing sensitive details like the amount or participants.

## Examples

### Multi-Signature Wallet Example

```csharp
// Create a multi-signature wallet that requires 2 out of 3 signatures
List<string> publicKeys = new List<string> { "key1", "key2", "key3" };
MultiSigWallet wallet = new MultiSigWallet(publicKeys, 2);

// Add a transaction that requires multiple signatures
Transaction tx = new Transaction("key1", "key2", 50);
if (wallet.AuthorizeTransaction(new List<string> { "key1", "key2" }))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Transaction authorized!");
}
```

### Cross-Shard Transaction Example

```csharp
// Transfer funds between shards
Transaction crossShardTx = new Transaction("Shard1Address", "Shard2Address", 200);
blockchain.HandleCrossShardTransaction(crossShardTx, 1, 2);
```

## Roadmap

- **Smart Contract Enhancements**: Integrate a Turing-complete virtual machine for executing complex dApps.
- **Layer 2 Scaling**: Add support for Layer 2 solutions like state channels and rollups.
- **Interoperability**: Implement cross-chain communication through atomic swaps and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
- **Advanced Privacy**: Include zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and RingCT for enhanced privacy features.
- **Improved P2P Networking**: Optimize the P2P layer using advanced block propagation methods like Graphene and Compact Block Propagation.
